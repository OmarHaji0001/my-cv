                            that gives learners an almost real, interactive driving experience. The small city
                            environment is programmed using the Unity game engine, populated with user-controlled
                            car, AI-driven cars and non-player characters. It contains a particular set of rules and
                            scenarios to test and improve userâ€™s driving skills. While playing, the player will
                            drive in the city in their car using a physical driving kit. Just as in actual physical
                            driving controller in a real car, when everything is realistic, the game is noticed to
                            have any violation of any rule or a mistake made by the player and, in turn, penalizes
                            it. There is notably a system called "rewind," in which the players may go back to the
                            moments that led to a mistake, where they can correct it. The AI cars follow realistic
                            driving patterns, creating a learning environment that mirrors real-world road
                            conditions. This project will already bridge the enormous gap between theoretical
                            knowledge regarding driving and practical application, with a very safe and controlled
                            learning environment where learners may practice and perfect their driving skills.</div>

                            fully stop for 5 seconds to ensure that no risks threaten his safety and use indicators
                            to show his intended destination. Any breaking of these rules will get him penalized.
                            When the AI car sensor detects the stop sign game object, the AI script will use
                            equations of motion by getting the velocity of the AI car and the remaining distance
                            between the first detection position and the stop zone position to apply the equations,
                            to ensure that the AI car will stop exactly at the correct stop zone. After waiting for
                            5 seconds, the AI car will decide to move and turn the wanted indicator on, but before
                            moving, the AI car will check if there are cars on the left if it wants to go in the
                            right direction, and it'll check right and left if it wants to go the left direction.
